# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I was struggling with just staring at my screen with functions and not knowing where to start. What I found very helpful from this week was pseudo-coding. 
Pseudo-coding makes it easier to understand what I am trying to accomplish in my function. I am still struggling with the math aspect of javascript especially with the arrays.
