## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Three ways to syntactically write a function are function declaration, function expression, and arrow function expression. A function declaration is defined and hoisted giving the ability to be used before defined. Function expression on the other hand does not need to be defined and are not hoisted. Function expressions cannot be used before they are defined. An arrow function expression is shorter syntax for writing a function expression.

2. What is the main difference between ***parameters*** and ***arguments***?

Parameters are used to define a function and arguments are the values that the function receives from the parameters once it has been invoked. 

3. What are ***higher-order functions***? Can you provide an example?

Higher-order functions are functions that accepts another function as their parameter. An example would be: array.prototype.map.
