## Questions

1. What is ***scope***?

Scope is where the variable declarations area available and accessed.

2. What is ***Hoisting***?

Hoisting is a mechanism where the variable declaration is at the top of the scope.

3. In what cases might you use `let` vs. `const` vs. `var`?

In cases where you want a variable that cannot be re-declared or updated the `const` variable declaration would be the most appropriate choice. If a declaration is needing to be re-declared or updated then the `var` would work the best. THen if a declaration is not needed to be global or updated the `let` variable declaration would work the best.
