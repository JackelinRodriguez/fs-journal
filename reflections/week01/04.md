## Questions

1. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?

2. What are the different levels of detail in wireframes, and why is each one useful?

The different levels of wireframes are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. Low-fidelity is useful when a developer is in a meeting and wants to sketch out a wireframe to get an idea. A mid-fidelity wireframe gives a more accurate representation of the layout without images/color. It can give a clear layout to the client. High-fideltiy wireframes include pictures and some complex concepts. It will be saved and used for the product's design cycle.

3. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Wireframes are worth the time and effort they give a clear visual representation of a webpage, making it easier for the future. They are a good basis for the developer and the client.
