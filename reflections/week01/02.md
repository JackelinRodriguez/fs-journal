## Questions

1. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A pseudo-class is a selector, it selects and element that are in a specific state. For example, the hover adds an effect where it seems like there was a class added to the code. The `:hover` pseudo-class would be the one I would most commonly use.

2. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is used by browsers to decide which rule is most relevant to the element. It may be beneficial to me where if I need to specifically change an element I am able to do so.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

The `!important` feature overrides all other rules on an element, the only other rule that can override this feature would be another `!important` declaration. If it is overused it may lead to problems in the code and it can potentially be full of `!important`.
