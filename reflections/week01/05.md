Week One

I didn't know what to expect for my first week at codeworks. The environment is so light in such a heavy vast subject. It is much appreciated. This week has been a victory for me all around. I already feel a little more comfortable with HTML and CSS. It's easier to get something on the page now rather than just staring at it and not knowing where to start. I am still overwhelmed with the thought of how vast coding is but am excited to dive into it. Especially because it is day 5 and I've already learned so much. I am using the dev tools more frequently it makes it so much easier with visualization. I am concerned with my time management. I take longer to put a website together, but I have learned some shortcuts this week. I'm hoping practice and better time management will help.
