## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip for improving your design? How does it benefit your site?

My favorite tip for improving my design would be rounding the edges on pictures, boxes, and buttons. It really helps the edges to not look so harsh on the page.

2. Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Resources that would be helpful: 
- Unsplash 
- Material Design Icons
- Bootstrap, it has so much information on styling 

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

The aesthetic of a website can persuade or even make the user feel like they NEED to buy a product. Good design makes it so much easier accomplish the websites goal whether it would be selling a product or maybe needing volunteers.
