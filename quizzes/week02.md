# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The keywords that are used to declare a variable would be let, var, and const. 
```
**2.** What is the definition of a function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A function is a statement that preforms some kind of task or calculation. A function also has an input and an output.
```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The `SOLID` principle is:
S - single responsibility
O - open-closed principle
L- liskov substitution principle
I- interface segregation principle
D- dependency inversion principle
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The position of pineapple in the array would be `fruit[2]`, because in coding it starts at zero not one.
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
let us = you.push("Them")
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
if (i > 0) {
  i++
}
The conditional is the `i > 0`, so if `i` is greater than zero the if statement will run. 
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  }//...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The name of the piece that belongs is the afterthought. I would put `i++` in the iteration to increase it by one.
```
**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
DOM stands for the Document Object Model, the first file accessed to render is HTML.
```

**9.** What are the `9` ECMAScript types as defined by MDN?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The nine ECMAScript types are: boolean (true or false), null (null value), undefined (property with undefined value), number (integer or floating number), bigint (integer with arbitrary precision), string (sequence of characters), symbol (unique/immutable data type).
```
**10.** When it comes to functions or methods, what is the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A parameter is the name created in the function definition and an argument is the values the function receives from each parameter. 
```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Primitive values are the basic types of data (float, boolean) and reference types are mostly considered as objects (objects, functions, arrays, collections).
